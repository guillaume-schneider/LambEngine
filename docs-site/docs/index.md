Welcome to the LambEngine technical documentation. This site focuses on how the
engine is built, how the runtime behaves, and how you integrate your project.

## What you will find here

- Getting Started: build requirements, setup, and your first run.
- Guides: deep dives into rendering, input, ECS, and configuration.
- Architecture: module boundaries, data flow, and update order.
- API Reference: module-level reference pages with links to deeper API docs.

## Quick paths

- New to the engine? Start with the [Installation](getting-started/installation) page.
- Need the big picture? Read [Architecture Overview](architecture).
- Looking for a feature? Jump into [Guides](guides/rendering).

## Documentation conventions

- Code snippets are illustrative. Adjust include paths and namespaces to your project.
- Sections marked "TODO" indicate areas to refine as APIs stabilize.
- Paths are shown relative to the repository root.

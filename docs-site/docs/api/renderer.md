This page summarizes rendering-facing types and helpers.

## Key types

- `Renderable`: data required to submit a draw.
- `Model`: mesh data and GPU handles.
- `Shader`: program abstraction and uniform binding.
- `Texture`: GPU texture resources and samplers.

## TODO

- Add creation and lifetime rules for GPU resources.
- Document render pass and material interfaces.
